The goal is that you'll be able to write c# and see any compile-time errors in real time. No need to build to see if it fails.

Eventually, I'd like to let you execute the code as you write it. I also want to allow more than one developer to work on a single piece of code concurrently. So if you make changes while I'm looking at the same code, I see your changes - and the effects that those changes have on the code's execution - in near real-time.
