Distilled: Compilify is like those, except with C#.

Distilled: The goal is that you'll be able to write c# in that textbox and see any errors in real time. No need to build to see if it fails

Distilled: eventually, I'd like to let you execute the code as you write it, but right now that's a bit of a security hazard

Distilled: I basically set up the environment your code runs in to already have the most basic .NET libraries available to it.
Distilled: It will tell you if it can't find a type that you're referencing, if you try to reference something outside those basic libraries.

Distilled: But I can't let users upload their own libraries or anything. I don't trust those.
Distilled: nah it throttles itself. It waits until you're done typing before hitting the server
Distilled: At most it will only make a request every half second
Distilled: But eventually
Distilled: (this is the cool-er part, next to being able to execute the code you write in real time, which is also pretty cool)
Distilled: Eventually, I want to allow more than one developer to work on a single piece of code concurrently. So if you make changes while I'm looking at the same code, I see your changes - and the effects that those changes have on the code's execution - in near real-time.
Distilled: Like, in under a second.

ParA: like
ParA: if theres multiple puzzle pieces
ParA: to the puzzle project
ParA: so if in my piece i call a function you're writing
ParA: and you update it
ParA: it knows to alter what i see
ParA: ?
ParA: i think function is the word im looking for
ParA: but again, idk what im talking about haha

Distilled: yeah, and for if you're having trouble understanding why a piece of code isn't working or producing the expected results, I can help you and we can try different approaches and see what the results of the different approaches are together
